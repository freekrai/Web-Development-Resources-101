Web Development Resources 101

This git repo is intended to be an all in one package for my own Web Development. I develop online and offline so while I normally load jQuery from Google Code I also may need to load it from an archive of jQuery if I am developing offline for a few days while I travel.

To that end I built this one morning. Feel free to use it for any personal or commercial project and no you don't need to reference me. I'm really only bundling free resources anyway.
