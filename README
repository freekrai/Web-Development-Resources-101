Web Development Resources 101

This git repo is intended to be an all in one package for my own Web Development. I develop online and offline so while I normally load jQuery from Google Code I also may need to load it from an archive of jQuery if I am developing offline for a few days while I travel.

To that end I built this one morning. Feel free to use it for any personal or commercial project and no you don't need to reference me. I'm really only bundling free resources anyway.

If you have some items that need to be added let me know.
